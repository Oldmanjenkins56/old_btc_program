# bitcoin-trading-platform

This program was made as a personal project in 2018. Since then my programming skills have improved and there are plenty of things I would have done differently, had I made it today. It was created as a mock Bitcoin trading platform to help teach users learn about crypto investing.

######Features:

• Allows the user to view realtime Bitcoin price and volume data, pulled from an API.

• Can open new positions and will calculate profit/loss.

• Switching between USD, GBP, CAD and AUD currencies is supported.

• Can save graphs to either a default folder or one that the user selects.

• Exporting data in Excel, CSV and text file formats is supported.

• Allows user to pause and resume the client.

• Allows user to change between a light and dark theme, and also change the plot colour for the line graph.
