Some features may not work as intended and Bitcoin pricing data may not be 100% accurate, all of the time. The intended use of this program is to teach potential crypto-investors how to trade Bitcoin to maximise profits and minimise loss. This is done by placing them in a realistic trading situation as practical experience is often regarded to be paramount for learning a new skill. All Bitcoin pricing and currency conversion data is taken from live APIs that constantly document the relevant information and relay it to the program. This way, data is more accurate to it's real-life counterpart which ensures the user gets a realistic representation of the trading market. All investments made within this program are purely fictional and have no bearing on the real world, or any real-life trading market. No real life funds are required to use this program.
